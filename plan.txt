GOAL: Run customizable simulations of FIRST Power Up games.

Be able to input at what times robots do certain tasks. Need to estimate how long each task will take (use Steamworks & past similar games?).

Answer these question:
1. Is is better to get the power cube in the scale vs the switch in autonomous?
2. What should the human player focus on putting blocks into the vault?
3. How many cubes are realistically needded to maintain ownership - should we stock up the vault first, own the switch/scale first?
4. Should we rely on the levitate button or should we focus on creating a robot that can support two other robots?

OUTLINE:
Have various tasks a robot can do, let people order the tasks, and see how many points you would get at the end of the game
Possibly have logic options (eg "bring cubes to exchange until vault is full" instead of "bring cube to exchange"x9)
Tasks:
- Bring cube to exchange
- Set cube on switch
- Set cube on scale
- Climb
etc

Loop through the "tick" method 150 times (where each loop represents a second of play) (maybe more than that? 300 times for every 1/2 second?) (150,000 times???)
Act out movement and point collection accordingly
